## 🔧 Key Technical Solutions

### **Problem 1: Multiple Password Labels**
**Issue**: "Password" and "Confirm Password" in register mode caused ambiguous queries.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ❌ Before: Ambiguous
screen.getByLabelText(/password/i)

// ✅ After: Specific
document.getElementById('password')
screen.getByLabelText(/^password$/i)  // Exact match
screen.getByLabelText(/confirm password/i)  // Specific
```

### **Problem 2: Zustand Store Mocking**
**Issue**: Can't mock Zustand stores directly.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ❌ Don't mock the hook
vi.mock('@/hooks/useAuth')

// ✅ Mock the dependency
vi.mock('@/lib/mockApi', () => ({
  mockApi: {
    login: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ user, token })),
    register: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve({ user, token })),
  }
}))
```

### **Problem 3: Button Text Mismatches**
**Issue**: Tests expected "Login" but actual text was "Sign In".

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ✅ Match actual UI text
screen.getByRole('button', { name: /sign in/i })
screen.getByRole('button', { name: /create account/i })
```

### **Problem 4: Async State Updates**
**Issue**: State updates not reflected immediately.

**Solution**:
```typescript
// ✅ Use waitFor for async updates
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText(/error message/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### **Do's** ✅
1. ✅ Mock at the API/service level, not at hooks
2. ✅ Use specific selectors for complex forms
3. ✅ Match actual UI text exactly
4. ✅ Test user behavior, not implementation details
5. ✅ Use `waitFor` for async operations
6. ✅ Cover all states (loading, error, empty, success)
7. ✅ Verify accessibility (ARIA, labels, keyboard nav)
8. ✅ Keep tests fast (< 2 seconds for 57 tests)

### **Don'ts** ❌
1. ❌ Don't mock Zustand stores directly
2. ❌ Don't use ambiguous queries (/password/i with multiple matches)
3. ❌ Don't assume button text (verify actual UI)
4. ❌ Don't test implementation details
5. ❌ Don't write slow tests
6. ❌ Don't skip accessibility tests
7. ❌ Don't use dynamic mocking when static works
